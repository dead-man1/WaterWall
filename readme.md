A simple core for tunneling and even direct user-server connections. based on high-performance, fully customizeable nodes for creating any kind of protocol without writing code for it.

To start please read the [docs](https://radkesvat.github.io/WaterWall-Docs/). (The documents are currently only in Persian language.)

# News

In order to bring back `Reality` support, a `TLS server` needs to be implemented. Unfortunately, this requires both HTTP client and server nodes.

Because OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) support is required to Match Nginx Tls fingerprinting.

This will extend the development timeline for the new version.

<!-- # Plan

- [x] Restructure the project into a much cleaner design  
- [ ] Remove OpenSSL/WolfSSL client, create a TLS client using curl-impersonate  
- [ ] Rework OpenSSL server, configure options to match Nginx identically  
- [ ] Focus on HTTP/1 or HTTP/2, make every option configurable via JSON  
- [ ] Redesign Layer 3 nodes with a different architecture  
- [x] Add support for WireGuard  
- [ ] Add support for Router  
- [ ] Implement more transports like HTTP/3 or a stream control node
